Correctly space words in a given log event description sentence and remove any unwanted spaces.

# Steps

1. **Identify Word Boundaries**: Analyze the given sentence to detect potential word boundaries.
2. **Remove Unwanted Spaces**: Eliminate any unnecessary spaces that may exist between words.
3. **Insert Correct Spaces**: Add appropriate spaces between words where needed to ensure the sentence is properly spaced.

# Output Format

Provide a single string that represents the correctly spaced version of the input sentence.

# Examples

**Input**: "Userloggedin at 10:00 AM"

**Output**: "User logged in at 10:00 AM"

**Input**: "Error occuredwhen connecting to the server"

**Output**: "Error occurred when connecting to the server"

**Input**: "<log>"

**Output**: "<log>"

# Notes

- Ensure that all output sentences are grammatically correct in terms of spacing.
- Be attentive to commonly compounded words that should not be separated (e.g., "login" instead of "log in" depending on context).
- Do not remove or add any characters that are not spaces.
- Input can be very short and simple. Consider any input to be a valid log message / description.
- It is possible that the input string is already properly formatted, in such case do not modify the text further.
